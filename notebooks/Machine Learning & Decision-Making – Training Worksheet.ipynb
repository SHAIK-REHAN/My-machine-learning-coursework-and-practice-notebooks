This makes the problem an unsupervised learning task. K-Means works by measuring distances between data points and forming clusters such that customers within the same cluster have similar characteristics and behavior patterns. These clusters can then be used by businesses to design targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, and customer-specific services.\n",

MDPs are designed for sequential decision-making problems, where the current decision affects future states and rewards. In such cases, the system learns an optimal policy that maximizes long-term rewards rather than making isolated decisions.\n",
